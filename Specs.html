    <h2>THE NEWEST IPHONE 16.</h2>
        <p class="center-p">As you might expect, there are a few upgrades in the latest iPhone 16 models compared to the iPhone 15 models, <br> but while it was the Pro models that stood out in 2023, it's the iPhone 16 models that offer the biggest differences this year. <br> We will be spending much more time with the iPhone 16 models over the coming weeks to really test their picture and sound performance, <br> as well as the rest of their features, so stay tuned for our full reviews.</p>
        <p class="center-p">Powered by the A18 Pro chip and built for Apple Intelligence, the Pro lineup introduces larger display sizes, Camera Control, innovative pro camera features, and a huge leap in battery life</p>
