    <h2>THE NEWEST IPHONE</h2>
        <p>As you might expect, there are a few upgrades in the latest iPhone 16 models <br> compared to the iPhone 15 models, but while it was the Pro models that stood <br> out in 2023, it's the iPhone 16 models that offer the biggest differences this year. <br> We will be spending much more time with the iPhone 16 models over the coming <br> weeks to really test their picture and sound performance, as well as the rest of <br> their features, so stay tuned for our full reviews.</p>
